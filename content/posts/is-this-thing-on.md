Well, this is my first post... Ever! Just seeing how things work and trying to figure it all out. So far Hugo seems to be pretty straight forward overall, there is a learning curve but not unexpected.

Hi, I'm Greg aka BitFlipped. I'm a computer engineer by trade and general tinker by interest. I've spun this thing up to share some of my experiences with others. Professionally i've spent most of my years in some technology based capacity; developing software and more recently more as a systems architect and manager in the cloud space.

It is my honest belief that the internet as a medium only truly flourishes when we put forth the effort to share our knowledge and experiences with each other.
