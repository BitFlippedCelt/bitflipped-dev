As with many things in life we are seeing a renaissance of sorts in a segment of our industry amongst hobbyists and diehards. People for many reasons looking to publish, server, and host content outside the influence of the big tech companies. A growing subculture of "self-hosters" is learning or re-learning the ins and outs of NGINX configurations. Overcoming the nuance of PHP optimization. Learning once again what it means to stand up a database using PostgreSQL or MariaDB/MySQL. For what feels like forever these "dark arts" have been mostly abandoned as companies pushed upward into the cloud. Leveraging "managed" offerings that generally were optimized and moreover, just work.

Content providers want to provide content, not worry about the "how" it is hosted, but merely focusing on the "what." Companies have created platforms to enhance a creator's ability to deliver on the "what" and not have to worry much about the "how." For years everyone was happy about how things worked and nobody worried much. Consumers watch, read, or otherwise consume the content in droves. All the while the big technology companies have been hard at work tweaking policies and quietly chipping away at the rights of both consumers and creators alike. As these restrictions have evolved out of creators' favor, a further catalyst for self-hosting has grown. The idea of my content, my infrastructure has begun to take hold. In a world where you can purchase a reliable computer that is capable of serving webpages and content for under $100, people began to see an opportunity. Forums have grown and ideas of old are new again. Once the realm of bulletin boards and baud-rates the internet is slowly seeing a resurgence of decentralization. Users are becoming unwilling to give up their rights to the things that they create.
