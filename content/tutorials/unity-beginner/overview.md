Learning together, let's mess around with Unity and build something fun! 

My background includes a ton of playing games, never really diving into building them. Coming from a development background as well as operations, I want to give this a go and see what happens.

I'll do my best to develop a base understanding and help to bring you along with me! This series of tutorials serves both as a journal of my learnings. As well as an opportunity to share that understanding with others in the best way that I can!
